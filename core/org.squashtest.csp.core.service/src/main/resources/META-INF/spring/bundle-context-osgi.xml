 	<!-- 
 		some explanations here : 
 		
 		* core.service publishes the datasource service
 		* tm.service consumes it, creates the SessionFactory then publishes it
 		* core.service consumes the SessionFactory service
 		
 		the dependencies between the beans consuming those services are acyclic.
 		
 		Unfortunately the dependencies between the bundles are cyclics : core.service and tm.service 
 		stay stuck in a dead lock while they are waiting each other to publish the services they need.
 		
 		There are no simple designs that would solve that problem and keep the security (centralized in core.service)
 		module-agnostic, as creating the SessionFactory in core.service would bring other problems.
 		
 		=======================
 		
 		The solution implemented here is weak : 
 		
 		* we set the service as optional while it's supposed to be mandatory, in order to have 
 		core.service starting anyway, 
 		
 		* we set the sticky flag to false, that should trigger the registration once the SessionFactory service
 		becomes available.

	<!--  
		pretty much the same problem here. To be specific, that thing should be instanciated here in core.service.
		the reason is that due to the rigid configuration of Spring security, we had to declare it, along with the main authentication manager, in
		core.web. That is : 
			- you can't delegate the authentication manager for one Spring context to a bean from another context (eg core.web and core.service)
			  so you must declare the authentication manager in the web context.
			- the UserDetailsService and AuthenticationManager need cross-references to each other that cannot be lazily initialized,
			  thus forbidding asynchronous OSGI-service injection.
		
		Spring DM, Spring security and Hibernate really need to talk together.
