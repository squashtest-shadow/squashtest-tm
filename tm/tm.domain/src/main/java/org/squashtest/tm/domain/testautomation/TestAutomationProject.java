/**

 * Like every entities in the package org.squashtest.tm.domain.testautomation, these are immutable : modifying servers, projects etc 
 * could break existing data. For instance changing the URL of a server, or its kind, means that a new instance of AutomatedTestServer should 
 * be persisted instead of altering the existing one. In other words, our objects here are immutable. When a setter is used, a new instance of 
 * this will be returned, with a null ID because this instance is still unknown.
